Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to the **Pathfinding Visualizer** web application! 

I developed this application out of an interest in pathfinding algorithms and a desire to visualize them in action. This project married my interests in algorithms and data structures with front-end development. I hope you enjoy exploring and interacting with this visualization tool as much as I enjoyed creating it.

## Supported Algorithms

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Weighted)**: The father of pathfinding algorithms; finds the shortest path.
- **A\* Search Algorithm (Weighted)**: Dijkstra's algorithm with heuristics added; favors the paths leading closer to the goal.
- **Breadth-First Search (Unweighted)**: Exploration of neighbors level by level; finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **Depth-First Search (Unweighted)**: Exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking; does not guarantee the shortest path.

## How It Works

Pathfinding algorithms are designed to find the shortest path between two points. This application puts a new spin on how these algorithms work, illustrating exactly how they do their thing.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm is one of the most popular ways to find out the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. It accomplishes this by doing the following:

1. **Initialization**: Dijkstra's assigns each node a tentative distance value, with a starting node of zero and all others at infinity.

2. **Nodes Visiting**: It chooses the unvisited node with the least tentative distance.

3. **Updating Neighbors**: It calculates the tentative distances of the neighboring nodes.

4. **Iteration**: This process is done repetitively until all nodes have been visited.

**Why Dijkstra's Algorithm?

- **Ensures the shortest path**: It looks through all the potential paths to determine which one delivers the fastest route.
- **Is very versatile**: Usage can be made with it in networking, mapping applications, and game development.
 
Limitations include:

- **No heuristic**: It doesn't take into consideration which direction it should be moving in toward its goal; this might cause inefficiency in huge graphs.
- **Performance**: Quite slow in performance with heavy graphs because it will blast its way into everything.
 
### A* Search Algorithm
 
The A* Algorithm takes Dijkstra's and adds a heuristic to it:

1. **Heuristic Function**: Estimates the cost from the current node to the goal, usually using Manhattan distance.
2. **Priority Queue**: It prioritizes nodes based on the sum of the cost to reach them and the heuristic estimate.
3. **Pathfinding Efficiency**: It turns its focus to those paths which look more promising hence decreasing unnecessary exploration.

**Advantages:**

- **Efficiency**: Generally, it's faster than Dijkstra's, thanks to the guided search.
- **Flexibility:** Heuristics can be tuned depending upon the problem domain one is dealing with.

### Example Visualization

- **Visited Nodes**: Nodes that have been explored by the algorithm.
- **Shortest Path**: The best path found from the start to the finish node.
- **Walls/Barriers**: Obstacles that the algorithms need to find a way around.

*(Place similar explanations for BFS and DFS here if you have implemented those.)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js (Version 16)**: Have Node.js on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinding-visualizer.git
cd pathfinding-visualizer
   ```
orsch

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   By default, the application would start at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. **Set Start and Finish Nodes**: The green node is the start, and the red node is the finish. You may drag them to new positions if you wish.

2. **Create Walls**: Click and drag on the grid to create walls/obstacles the algorithms will work around.

3. **Choose an Algorithm**: To visualize an algorithm, click on the button corresponding to which one you'd like to see come into action.

4. **Visualize**: Actually watch the algorithm make its way around the grid in real-time.

5. **Reset**: This button resets the grid after the visualization for a fresh start.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend Framework**: This will be designed using [React](https://reactjs.org/); as such, there will be heavy use of components and state management for interactivity in the UI.

- **Algorithms Implemented**:

  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: A priority queue selects the next node with the minimum tentative distance.

  - **A\* Search Algorithm**: A heuristic estimates the probable cost to reach the goal and thereby makes the process much more efficient.

- **Data Structures**:

  - **Grid Representation**: It represents the grid in a 2D array form where each node of the array contains properties like distance, isVisited, and previousNode.

  - **Priority Queue**: This data structure is used in algorithms to select the next node efficiently to visit.

- **Animations**: It demonstrates, using CSS animation, how algorithms would progress over a series of time showing visual feedback on it.

## Future Improvements

- **More Algorithms**: Incorporate other algorithms, like Greedy Best-First Search, Bidirectional Search, etc.

Tasks to be implemented:

- **Maze Generation**: Allow the generation of random mazes and patterns.
- **Weight Adjustment**: Give an ability to a user to assign weights to nodes, making some paths costlier.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Better optimization on a mobile platform in terms of the UI.
- **User Customization**: Allow users to change colors, speeds, etc.

## Acknowledgements

- **Inspiration**: While taking my first university classes in the field of Computer Science, I often found it challenging to work with algorithms. Sometimes, their abstract nature was difficult to grasp and relate to because of how it applies in reality. That is why I decided to undertake this project-to delve deep and understand these algorithms not by just implementing them but also by visualizing their behavior in real time. This project became personal to me in terms of discovery, and now I am so excited to share it with others.

This documentation, together with an interactive demo, should become useful to anyone like me who aims to close the gap between theory and practice. Also, playing with the visualizations should make the notion of these algorithms clearer and intuitive for the user.
